## [Maker100-eco  Robotics, IoT and Machine Learning](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100-eco)

#### Using the XiaoEsp32s3 and the RAK2270DeveloperStickerTracker
#### For High School Grade 11,12 or 1st,2nd year university
#####
 Grouped for clarity, I won't teach in this order

Spring 2024 order: basic using the XIAO, then half of senses, then some Machine learning, then half of actuators, then ML onto the XIAO-esp32, then some IoT. 
THEN I expected all the assignments in order. 2nd term I will start the RAK2270 and the final projects.

## Basics using the XiaoEsp32s3

### Machine Learning

#### One Hour Session

1. Follow the Sensecraft Vision example

#### One Day Conference
1. Make a vision classification machine learning model using your cell phone
1. Xiao Esp32s3 LED Blink and Serial Print
1. Put the one hour conference Vision model on the XiaoEsp32s3
1. Using your cell phone to make a FOMO model
1. Put the FOMO model onto the XiaoEsp32s3
1. Use your cell phone to make a Sound Model

#### 2nd Day Conference
1. Put the sound model onto your XiaoEsp32s
1. (optional) Try the Edgeimpulse connection method
1. Edge-Impulse-Sound-Yes-No
1. Edge-Impulse-Vision-FOMO
1. XiaoEsp32s3 camera to micro sd-card to FOMO model to XiaoEsp32s3
1. EdgeImpulse cell phone motion x,y,z model

## Final Course Projects

1. One sensor with one actuator Individual final project
1. Multi sensor and/or multi actuator and/or machine learning Individual final project
1. Group Final Project

(It's robotics if one of those projects actually woirks I am happy as a teacher and can pass the student. Students can get an A grade with only 1 solid final project)
