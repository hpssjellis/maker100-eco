Most of the orginal sketches were from the Arduino Library [Portenta Pro Community Solutions](https://github.com/hpssjellis/portenta-pro-community-solutions/tree/main/examples) that used a complex dot#### system to code each example.

Not sure yet if I will maintain the dot#'s or not, but code for the Seeedstudio XIAO  Esp32s3 - Sense should be in this folder until moved to a proper Arduino library.


Most of this code was copied from my repository called   [mcu-stable-edu-launch](https://github.com/hpssjellis/mcu-stable-edu-launch)


look at the seed and rak folders
