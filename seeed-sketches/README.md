Most of the orginal sketches were from the Arduino Library [Portenta Pro Community Solutions](https://github.com/hpssjellis/portenta-pro-community-solutions/tree/main/examples) that used a complex dot#### system to code each example.

Not sure yet if I will maintain the dot#'s or not, but code for the Seeedstudio XIAO  Esp32s3 - Sense should be in this folder until moved to a proper Arduino library.


Most of this code was copied from my repository called   [mcu-stable-edu-launch](https://github.com/hpssjellis/mcu-stable-edu-launch)


look at the seed and rak folders



PIXY2 advanced with SS on XIAO D0 so that other SPI devices could be attached (hopefully)

will need looking at this page    https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v2:porting_guide  and deciding on SPI with SS I2C or UART.  Note that these setting are defined using the Pixymon configuration.  SPI SS is kind of diffiuclt.
