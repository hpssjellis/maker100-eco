Most of the orginal sketches were from the Arduino Library [Portenta Pro Community Solutions](https://github.com/hpssjellis/portenta-pro-community-solutions/tree/main/examples) that used a complex dot#### system to code each example.

Not sure yet if I will maintain the dot#'s or not, but code for the RAK or XIAO should be in this folder until moved to a l_brary.
